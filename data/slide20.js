Site Map:	The home page index.html will contain the site map and will be the main page from which all the others stem.	Purpose:	It will be designed in a way that clearly conveys the purpose of the site.	There will be tabulated data giving details on opening times of the various activities in the area.	CSS &amp; html:	There will be sidebars for to fit maximum relevant information into the pages for the user to scroll through with ease.	There will be an external style sheet that contains the instructions for the html and live preview.	This CSS style sheet will also contain specifications for the page container so that when opened in various computer applications it holds the same structure in place.	Links:	The links will be by external internet links to sites associated with the area, internal links to topics on different pages through the addition of buttons to the home page. These will be located in the search bar.	There will be photographs and sketches floated using CSS and html and some of these will be live so that when hovered over it will be clear that they area links to more about the photo and its representations. When clicking on these they will lead to the information. 	The hover on text and pictures will have a colour function will vary according to users: hover, visited, active. This makes it easier for the user to see what they have and have not viewed.	Contact us form:	There will be a ‘Contact Us’ form so that users queries can be answered.	Future development on navigation:	Also, I am considering users that may be short of sight. Over time a development on this website would be to add an audio link to the content information."/></div></div></div>');})();
