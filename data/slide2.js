Clare called Bunratty; Bún-Ráite in Irish. 	I have chosen this project to develop as I have an interest in nature and culture and the interface between them which we know as a “sense of place.”	Bunratty takes its name from the river that flows through it. This gives us an idea of its roots and how it grew to the place it is today.	There have been changes in industries associated with the river from the fishing culture and Water-Mills of the C15th to what is today a thriving tourist location.	It has gained media attention recently for the dolphin pods which frequent the river up from the River Shannon.	There have been many transitions in its history over time. Here, the village became established because of its river traversing through and its strategic location where it meets the River Shannon at Bunratty."/></div></div></div>');})();
