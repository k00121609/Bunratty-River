The Bunratty river meets the river Shannon and the Atlantic ocean with characteristic mud-flats exposed at low-tides which is a feature of the third stage of any river. The findings date back to ancient occupation, dwelling and living centred around the Bunratty river. These have been radio-carbon dated to identify them as of Mesolithic, Neolithic, Bronze Age, early Christian, medieval and post-medieval times. Along the upper parts of the river there are ringforts and tombs dating back to the bronze age.	along the path of the Bunratty river have been found significant evidence of pre-historic settlements. Bronze and gold metalworks discovered in lakes and bogs associated with the river amongst other remnants. 	the river has also served as boundary for the early medieval region of Tradraighe, while the wider locality was an area of military contention between the native Irish and the Anglo-Norman colonialists. This occurred from the 12th to the 15th centuries. 	 subsequent post-medieval settlements lead centred around the English commission who brought Dutch settlers to the area developing the water-mill industries along the Bunratty river and are evident from the mid-17th century onwards.
