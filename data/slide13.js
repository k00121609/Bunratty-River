The water-mills wheels gave electricity to work the mill and gave light to the village at 6 pence a bulb. 	In later years:	The mills located along the Bunratty River had  for long been a source of thriving industry for this South East Clare area. 	They had an interesting if not controversial beginning:	About 1695 a commission of the English parliament decided that the people of what they called the Limerick area in which they included the Bunratty area, were ‘idle’ and ‘unenterprising’. 	They stated that what was needed was an infusion of Dutch enterprise to liven the place up. 	Many of these settlers came to the Bunratty-Sixmilebridge area, as the river was noted for being suitable for milling and became a part of the community.	 the mill-owners made an agreement with the E.S.B. to take over the electricity of the village. 	Street lights were powered by the turbine on the mill. The mill later progressed to be powered by gas engines and the electricity from the turbines. 	There were no similar mills in County Clare at this time.
