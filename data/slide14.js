Indeed, it appears prominent though secondary to the castle today. However, there was a time where the Bunratty river was the reason for all settlements including castles and industry in this area. 	Castle built on an island in the river:	Originally, the castle was built on an island of the Bunratty river called the ‘Island of Tradree.’ At that time, it would have been more closely identified with the northern bank of the river Shannon, a strategic location for trade. This is where the Bunratty river joins the river Shannon to its left and the Atlantic ocean to its right, the link to the ocean which accounts for the tidal nature of this river. The later was the reason for the development of water-mill industries in later years and the development of settlements around these businesses.	Continuation over time:	The nature of the castle on an island in a river continued from the middle ages through to the end of the 18th century. Before the time of the mills, the location was strategic as it commanded the medieval waterway-traffic to limerick which was considered as most important gateway and port to the south-west of Ireland. 	Battles and wars on the river, a turbulent history:	Not surprisingly, therefore, there have been many battles, wars and conquests of this castle and its water-way importance. The ownership, mostly through the winning of battles fought for to conquer the location with a turbulent history of over 500 years. Significantly during the Norman occupation, the river provided a great water-filled ditch/channel surrounding the castle using the Bunratty River as a resource in protecting their castle.	Based on the research I have put together a table of sequence of events of contributors to the area:	I have noticed through my research that there is not a timeline available for those who participated in the building of the castle from its strategic river location, so I put together a table of sequence of events."/></div></div></div>');})();
