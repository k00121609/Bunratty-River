The Bunratty River has been well known over time as mixed-fishing river. Today Anglers use this river to catch: salmon, pike, roach, rudd, perch, bream, brown-trout and sea trout. 	The fishing of the Bunratty River is controlled by the No.8 or Limerick District of the Shannon Regional Fisheries Board and the Environmental Protection Agency(EPA).	There are from the Shannon Regional Fisheries Board and the EPA, restrictions on the fishing use of the river:	In 2015, the Bunratty river which was open for “catch and release” was closed for that year.	This year, 2016 the river was re-opened for “catch and release” along the river. This means there is permitted ‘catch and release’ of wild fish and harvesting of hatchery salmon. Anglers are not allowed to: use worms; single, barbless hooks and the fish must be handled carefully and not to be removed from the water before release.	Effects of flood-relief works:	The physical works scheme of flood alleviation if anything has improved the fish carrying capacity of the lower Bunratty river towards Bunratty. It is now shallower and less shaded and this results in the increased aquatic macrophyte growth which in turn may boost coarse fish stocks"/></div></div></div>');})();
