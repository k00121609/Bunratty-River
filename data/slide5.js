This is a website that would incorporate information on the Bunratty River and its Associations; cultural and natural.	I have approached this concept from the point of interest of the River and all that has grown up around it since ancient times.	There will be a main integrated home page index.html that will have navigation links to the subsequent pages.	There is a requirement of the project not to infringe copyright so to add interest and entertainment value I will add my own photographs and text	The visual and working aspects of this concept in relation to the end-product is outlined in the Balsamiq Wireframe Prototype.	The aim is also to reach out to various audience types; locals, tourists, nature and history enthusiasts.	My plan includes in the long term a site where people can add and develop the site with further information. This would be another aspect of its interactivity."/></div></div></div>');})();
