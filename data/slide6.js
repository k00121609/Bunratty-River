I have added a page of the website for restaurants, cafes, hotels and pubs, with photographs and contact details of same. The idea of this is that when people do an internet search on Bunratty, very often it is the tourism industry and in particular places to eat/drink, so this site may open up another angle on Bunratty as a place; its culture, geography and history over time. These places through are an integral part of the culture of Bunratty, therefore, it is an important link to the Bunratty River overall project website.	The history of the town and its river: those with an interest in local, regional and national history.	The unique geologic and nature ecosystems of the river: nature enthusiasts.	People from the area and adjoining towns that have a general interest in their own local area."/></div></div></div>');})();
