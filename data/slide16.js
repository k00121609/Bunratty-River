It incorporates the western-side of the Slieve Bernagh-Woodcock Hill upland and the eastern part of the gentle undulating south Clare limestone lowland. 	River Path: 	This river flows through a shallow river valley. It is typically narrow and shallow with areas of wet-land reed-beds located towards the its southern orientation. It takes a gentle, meandering course with areas of the river floodplain most obvious in Bunratty village. 	This river is tidal and it drains into the Shannon Estuary at Bunratty where there are extensive mud-flats. At the upper part of the river the geology is predominately of gravel and rock.	Arthur Young: 	In 1766, agriculturist and author Arthur Young paid a visit to sir. Lucas O’Brien who held the seat at Dromoland south in county Clare at that time. 	Land-use: 	There were native woods of oak, ash and popular along the hill-sides adjoining the Bunratty river. These were a source for construction far and wide across the country.	Land-use contd:	Oil was produced from rape seed grown in large quantities on the adjoining mountains which was processed into oil in the Bunratty river mills.	Rent: 	The average rent for lands in the carcass area was 5 shillings. However, it has been recorded that twenty thousand acres from paradise hill along the river Fergus and Shannon, through Bunratty and as far as limerick was let at 20 shillings an acre.	river_geography.docx	Most of the upland ranges in elevation from 60-300m, the highest point being over 500m. The elevation of the lowland ranges from 5-50m.	O’Brien furnished young with a large amount of useful geographical information on the carcass lands of Traderee. 	This spanned from Dromoland to Limerick. Bunratty lies at the heart of this referred to area.	The low-lying carcass lands were more suitable for agriculture. The soils of the corcass are of rich black loam or deep blue clay. 	The Lowland occupies less than half of the total catchment area.	The best lands are of limestone or limestone gravel and the surrounding mountains are mostly of grit stone. 	Land for tillage and the sowing of 12 store of wheat to an acre in the corcass would yield a crop almost twice that of elsewhere. 	The woodlands are part of the Ancient Wood of Sudain that was originally part of the Slieve Aughty range. It is said to have some of the oldest beech and oak tress in Ireland today."/></div></div></div>');})();
